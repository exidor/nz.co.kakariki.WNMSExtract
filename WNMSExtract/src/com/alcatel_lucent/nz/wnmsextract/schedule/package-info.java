 * The schedule package is a multi tasking interface that can be configured
 * with user editable properties files.
 * Note. Currently not able to be run since its development was put on hold when
 * it was discovered that, because of RAM limitations on the offered hardware,
 * multiple simultaneous processes couldn't be supported. The classes in ths
 * package will require some maintenance before being deployed into production.
